# ðŸ“„ Text File Zipper using Huffman Encoding

This project is a **Text File Compressor and Decompressor** built using **Huffman Encoding** in Java. It was developed as part of the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Semester Project**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This program compresses and decompresses **only text files** using Huffman Encoding. Huffman Encoding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns shorter binary codes to frequently occurring characters, reducing file size without losing any data.

âš  **Important:** This program works **only with text files (`.txt`)**. Other file types are **not supported**.

## ðŸš€ Features
âœ” **Compresses text files using Huffman Encoding**  
âœ” **Decompresses files back to original text**  
âœ” **Efficient for large text files (MBs in size)**  
âœ” **Ensures that only text files are processed**  
âœ” **Reduces file size significantly**  

---

## ðŸ›  How It Works
1. **File Selection:** Choose a `.txt` file for compression.
2. **Compression:** The program builds a Huffman Tree based on character frequency and encodes the text using optimized binary sequences.
3. **Decompression:** The encoded file is decoded back to its original form using the Huffman Tree.
