Select a file:

The file will be compressed using Huffman Encoding. It is necessary that the file being compressed is a Text-File Only.
Preferebally use a longer text file with size in MBs and then compress, decompress it so you can visibly see the compression easily
If you need help regarding the implementation as it as an advanced, confusing topic, you may contact me at mohibkhansherwani@gmail.com
